  The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire perio

PyPoll answers theses questions in the export file:

  A complete list of candidates who received votes
